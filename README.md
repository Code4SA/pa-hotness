project-template
================

Template for code4sa web applications. 


## What does this project do

This project is an empty template for new code4sa projects.

This space should be used for describing a project's intended purpose.

## How it works

Describe the main user interface, and provide a link if it is already in production.

If the project implements an API, list the API endpoints.

To start out with this template on a new project:

    1. Create a new empty repo on GitHub, called my-new-project
    2. Checkout this template to the new project's directory on your local drive
        git clone git@github.com:Code4SA/project-template.git my-new-project
    3. Update the project's "origin" remote to point to the new GitHub repo:
        cd my-new-project
        git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Code4SA/my-new-project.git
    4. Push the template to the empty GitHub repo:
        git push origin master
