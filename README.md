pa-hotness
================

"Hot or Not" style app for getting to know your representatives in parliament. Information on candidates comes form the
People's Assembly website at http://www.pa.org.za/organisation/national-assembly/people/

The backend exposes a couple of API endpoints, and a little Admin interface for managing the site's data.
